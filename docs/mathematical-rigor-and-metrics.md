# Mathematical rigor and measurement framework

This framework brings rigorous quantitative methods to business validation and couples them to practical measurement and success criteria.

## Statistical rigor

- Hypothesis testing
  - Use t-tests (Welch) or non-parametric tests (future) to validate differences between variants and cohorts
  - Require pre-registered hypotheses and stopping rules
- Regression analysis
  - Linear regression to identify relationships (e.g., CAC vs retention, spend vs signups)
  - Multivariate analysis for interactions across business model dimensions (future: multiple regression/logistic)
- Model calibration
  - Fit parameters using historical data; track residuals and R² to avoid overfit; maintain version lineage

## Quantitative approaches

- Stochastic models
  - For pricing and risk, consider stochastic processes (future: GBM or jump-diffusion for advanced cases)
- Monte Carlo simulations
  - Use `src/lib/adaptiveSimulation.ts` to estimate distributions (e.g., payback months, LTV:CAC bands)
  - Report p50/p90 and probabilities for decision support
- Linear programming (optimization)
  - Optimize business model parameters (e.g., media mix, price vs retention trade-offs) under constraints (future module)
- Time series analysis
  - Identify patterns and forecast demand; track drift; alert on regime changes (future module)

## Success metrics

- Cycle time reduction: target 50–70% faster validation cycles
- Detection accuracy: >95% business model detection accuracy once ML is fully deployed
- Adoption: >90% user adoption within six months of rollout in target teams
- Cost reduction: 20–30% reduction in validation process costs

## Where it lives in the repo

- Stats helpers: `src/lib/adaptive/stats.ts` (t-test, linear regression)
- Simulations: `src/lib/adaptiveSimulation.ts` (payback, LTV:CAC)
- Policy mapping: `src/lib/adaptive/policy.ts` (framework activations and criteria)
- Rules: `/api/rules` for hot updates and versioning

## Next steps

- Add multiple regression/logistic helpers for multivariate modeling
- Introduce a small optimization module for linear programming tasks
- Add optional time series utilities for seasonal/structural change detection
