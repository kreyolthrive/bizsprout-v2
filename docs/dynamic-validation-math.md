# Mathematical Foundations for Dynamic Validation

Dynamic validation treats business models as evolutionary, adaptive systems. This note sketches a practical, minimal math stack that maps theory to an implementable engine.

## 1) Dynamic Consistency and Uncertainty

- Business contexts evolve; input signals are stochastic. Use probabilistic models to reflect uncertainty and path-dependence.
- Minimal stack in code:
  - Monte Carlo simulation for unit economics under uncertainty (e.g., payback months, LTV:CAC distributions)
  - Time horizons and caps to avoid unrealistic tails
  - Saturation-aware caps in saturated categories

### Monte Carlo example (implemented)

We simulate payback time as a random walk over monthly contribution when the customer has not churned. At each month t:

- Contribution_t ~ Normal(meanMonthlyContribution, sdMonthlyContribution)
- Survival_t ~ Bernoulli(1 - churnRateMonthly)
- Cumulative profit starts at -CAC and adds contribution while active; payback is the first month where cum >= 0.

This yields a distribution of payback months and the probability of payback within 12 months.

## 2) Contingency Theory in Scoring

- Different business models emphasize different success drivers. Weights and gates must adapt by model.
- In code: `DEFAULT_WEIGHTS`, `DEFAULT_GATES` in `src/lib/adaptiveValidation.ts`.
- The engine computes Overall_10 = ∑ d_i × w_i and applies saturation caps where appropriate.

## 3) Systems Thinking and Feedback Loops

- Validation isn’t a one-shot test. We use improvement loops and model-aware milestones (e.g., cohorts and credentials for learning marketplaces, COGS/shipping for physical subscriptions).
- We surface cap reasons and gate violations to encourage targeted experiments that change inputs over time.

## 4) Optional Advanced Extensions

These are not required to ship value but map to the theory when you need more rigor:

- Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) for price and CAC processes: dX_t = μX_t dt + σX_t dW_t; discretize with Euler-Maruyama for simulation when time-coupled shocks matter.
- Bayesian updates for demand evidence: prior → posterior with interview/sign-up data; update dimension posteriors and weights.
- Time-series models (ARIMA/ETS) for retention curves and seasonality (especially DTC/physical subscription).

## 5) RCOV Mapping (Resources, Competences, Organization, Value)

Use RCOV as a lens to assign experiments and milestones:

- Resources: instructors/suppliers, capital, brand, data assets
- Competences: curation, QA, onboarding, distribution partnerships
- Organization: escrow, QA stages, credentials, community operations
- Value: outcomes (payback, LTV:CAC, completion), NPS, leakage reduction

These map directly to platform loyalty, milestones, and experiments per model.

## 6) Practical Usage in the Repo

- Engine: `src/lib/adaptiveValidation.ts` — choose weights, evaluate gates, apply caps; returns a transparent snapshot.
- Simulation: `src/lib/adaptiveSimulation.ts` — Monte Carlo for payback and LTV:CAC under uncertainty.
- API: `pages/api/validate.ts` — attaches `adaptive_validation` for the UI; category-specific content already adapts.

## 7) Success Criteria

- Transparency: UI can show model weights, caps, and violations.
- Adaptivity: Different models produce different priorities and next steps.
- Rigor: Monte Carlo ranges for key economics; realistic caps in saturated markets.
- Iteration: Weekly improvement loops tailored by model, moving scores predictably.
