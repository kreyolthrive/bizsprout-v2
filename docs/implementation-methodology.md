# Implementation methodology (12-month, 4 phases)

This methodology guides the delivery of an adaptive validation platform across four phases with clear deliverables and success metrics. It integrates COPIS diagnostics, ISO 14971 risk practices, and change management via Kotter’s 8-Step and ADKAR to ensure sustained adoption and cultural shift toward truth-seeking and continuous learning.

## Phase 1 (Months 0–3): Assessment & Planning

Objectives

- Run comprehensive operational diagnostics of existing validation workflows (COPIS: Customers, Outputs, Process, Inputs, Suppliers)
- Establish baseline metrics, constraints, and risks (ISO 14971-inspired risk identification, evaluation, control)
- Stakeholder analysis and alignment of incentives and constraints

Key activities

- Value stream mapping of current validation process; identify bottlenecks and data gaps
- Risk register setup: hazard identification; probability × severity scoring; initial controls
- Data inventory and access controls; privacy/compliance baseline
- Target-state architecture and phased scope (tech, policy, governance)

Deliverables

- Current-state assessment, risk register, baseline KPIs
- Target-state architecture and roadmap (this repo’s hexagonal ports + ML + rules + resilience)
- Change strategy outline: Kotter step 1–3 (urgency, guiding coalition, vision)

Success metrics

- Alignment: stakeholder sign-off on scope and objectives
- Readiness: data availability coverage (e.g., ≥80% of required inputs mapped)
- Risk clarity: top 10 risk items documented with initial controls

## Phase 2 (Months 3–6): Foundation Build

Objectives

- Stand up adaptive engine integrations and the rules runtime with admin workflows
- Implement resilient classification path (heuristics → ML service with circuit breaker)

Key activities

- Wire ClassificationPort (heuristic primary, ML secondary via breaker)
- Implement RuleEnginePort + `/api/rules` for hot updates; seed guardrails
- Establish core validation flows (SaaS, marketplace, DTC physical, regulated) in the ValidationPort
- Instrumentation and audit (structured logs; basic telemetry)

Deliverables

- Operational adaptive pipeline in staging (heuristic-first)
- JSON rules catalog with governance and rollback procedures
- Initial dashboards for validation outcomes and rule effects

Success metrics

- Typecheck/CI green, p50 validation latency within SLO (e.g., <300ms without ML)
- Rule update lead time: <10 minutes from authoring to effect
- ML fallback resilience: <1% requests blocked when ML unavailable

## Phase 3 (Months 6–9): Expansion & ML Enablement

Objectives

- Bring t‑SNE + spectral classifier online; expand model coverage and evidence sources
- Tighten regulatory pathways and uncertainty reporting

Key activities

- Deploy Python microservice; calibrate thresholds and caching strategy
- Add uncertainty bands to UI via Monte Carlo utilities
- Expand regulated validations (pathway assessment, documentation completeness checks)
- A/B tests for rule variants; ramp plans

Deliverables

- ML classification integrated with graceful degradation
- UI uncertainty panels for select models (physical-subscription, marketplace)
- Enhanced regulated flow with pathway artifacts and status

Success metrics

- Classification acceptance: agreement with human labels ≥85% on validation set
- p95 latency meets SLOs with breaker; cache hit rate ≥60% for repeat inputs
- Reduction in false-positive validations by ≥20% from baseline

## Phase 4 (Months 9–12): Scale & Operationalization

Objectives

- Harden governance, security, and performance under higher load
- Embed cultural shift: truth-seeking, continuous improvement

Key activities

- Formalize change management: Kotter steps 4–8 and ADKAR (awareness→reinforcement)
- Run game-days for breaker/regression scenarios; refine dashboards and alerts
- Knowledge transfer, playbooks, and training; embed post-mortem practice

Deliverables

- Production-ready governance (review boards, versioning, audit)
- Scalability tuning; resiliency runbooks; training materials

Success metrics

- MTTR for rule regressions < 1 day; no-sev1 incidents related to ML outages
- Adoption: >70% of targeted teams using the platform weekly
- Sustained outcomes: quarterly improvements in validation precision/recall

## Change management practices

- Kotter’s 8-Step: build urgency; coalition; vision; communicate; remove obstacles; short wins; sustain; anchor
- ADKAR: awareness, desire, knowledge, ability, reinforcement embedded in the rollout plan
- Cultural shift: shift from “prove you’re right” to “discover the truth” using blameless reviews and hypothesis-driven experimentation

## Budget and ROI guidance

- Budget allocation (typical ranges):
  - 30–40% technology infrastructure (platform, data, ML service, observability)
  - 25–35% consulting expertise (domain, compliance, data science, change)
  - 20–25% change management (enablement, training, comms)
  - 10–15% contingency and ongoing support
- Expected ROI: >3:1 within 18 months of full implementation
