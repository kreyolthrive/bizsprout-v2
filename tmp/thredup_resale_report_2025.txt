Throughout the last decade, resale has proven that it has real staying power 

despite economic uncertainties and the challenges of a fragmented market. 

This year's Resale Report reveals that as consumers are increasingly thinking 

secondhand first, the retail industry is adopting powerful new pathways for 

resale. From the integration of social commerce and innovative AI applications 

to the establishment of trade organizations and interfacing with government 

and policymakers – it’s clear why resale is seeing accelerated growth. As we look 

to the year ahead, we’re energized by the report’s insights and feel a renewed 

sense of purpose and dedication to shaping a better future for the fashion 

industry. Let this report be your guide to the exciting possibilities that lie ahead.
